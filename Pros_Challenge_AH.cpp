//best time to buy a product
// use historical data to predict future price of product and be able to tell when the most optimal time to buy product is
// this will be useful to groups seeking to make large burchases where evey advantage helps, in fields as varied as munifacturing, to agriculture and even supply chain mangemnt
// way to do this is by gathering data set, applying a 

// Random Forest and five different ensemble methods such as Adaptive
// Boosting (AdaBoost), GredientBoost,eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Bagging, LighGBM (Light Gradient Boosted
// Machine) were used to improve upon the baseline model.
// Ensemble methods are chosen for this experiment because they
// are proven to perform well from small to medium seized data
// set.

// this is all from this paper "Predicting Price of Daily Commodities using "Machine Learning"
// https://doi.org/10.1109/3ICT51146.2020.9312012


// this should do the job
// all that's left is testing and making the app
